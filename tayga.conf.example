# Sample configuration file for TAYGA 0.9.6

# Modify this to use your own addresses!!
#

#
# TUN device that TAYGA will use to exchange IPv4 and IPv6 packets with the
# kernel.  You may use any name you like, but `nat64' is recommended.
#
# This device may be created before starting the tayga daemon by running
# `tayga --mktun`.  This allows routing and firewall rules to be set up prior
# to commencement of packet translation.
#
# Mandatory.
#
tun-device nat64

#
# TAYGA's IPv4 address.  This is NOT your router's IPv4 address!  TAYGA
# requires its own address because it acts as an IPv4 and IPv6 router, and
# needs to be able to send ICMP messages.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMP
# echo requests (ping) at this address.
#
# This address can safely be located inside the dynamic-pool prefix.
#
# Mandatory.
#
ipv4-addr 192.168.255.1

#
# TAYGA's IPv6 address.  This is NOT your router's IPv6 address!  TAYGA
# requires its own address because it acts as an IPv4 and IPv6 router, and
# needs to be able to send ICMP messages.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMP
# echo requests (ping6) at this address.
#
# You can leave ipv6-addr unspecified and TAYGA will construct its IPv6
# address using ipv4-addr and the NAT64 prefix.
#
# Optional if the NAT64 prefix is specified, otherwise mandatory.  It is also
# mandatory if the NAT64 prefix is 64:ff9b::/96 and ipv4-addr is a private
# (RFC1918) address.
# 
#ipv6-addr 2001:db8:1::2

#
# The NAT64 prefix.  The IPv4 address space is mapped into the IPv6 address
# space by prepending this prefix to the IPv4 address.  Using a /96 prefix is
# recommended in most situations, but all lengths specified in RFC 6052 are
# supported.
#
# This must be a prefix selected from your organization's IPv6 address space
# or the Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96.  Note that using the Well-Known
# Prefix will prohibit IPv6 hosts from contacting IPv4 hosts that have private
# (RFC1918) addresses, per RFC 6052.
#
# The NAT64 prefix need not be specified if all required address mappings are
# listed in `map' directives.  (See below.)
#
# Optional.
#
prefix 2001:db8:1:ffff::/96
# prefix 64:ff9b::/96

#
# Enable restrictions on use of the well-known prefix (64:ff9b::/96)
# Prevents translation of non-global IPv4 address ranges when
# using the well-known prefix
# 
# This option must be enabled for RFC 6052 compliance and is enabled by default
# 
wkpf-strict no

#
# Dynamic pool prefix.  IPv6 hosts which send traffic through TAYGA (and do
# not correspond to a static map or an IPv4-translatable address in the NAT64
# prefix) will be assigned an IPv4 address from the dynamic pool.  Dynamic
# maps are valid for 124 minutes after the last matching packet is seen.
#
# If no unassigned addresses remain in the dynamic pool (or no dynamic pool is
# configured), packets from unknown IPv6 hosts will be rejected with an ICMP
# unreachable error.
#
# Optional.
#
dynamic-pool 192.168.255.0/24

#
# Persistent data storage directory.  The dynamic.map file, which saves the
# dynamic maps that are created from dynamic-pool, is stored in this 
# directory.  Omit if you do not need these maps to be persistent between
# instances of TAYGA.
#
# Tayga will also respect the environment variable STATE_DIRECTORY if
# this configuration flag is not set
#
# Optional.
#
#data-dir /var/lib/tayga

#
# Establishes a single-host map.  If an IPv6 host should be consistently
# reachable at a specific IPv4 address, the mapping can be specified in a
# `map' directive.  (IPv6 hosts numbered with an IPv4-translatable address do
# not need map directives.)
#
# IPv4 addresses specified in the `map' directive can safely be located inside
# the dynamic-pool prefix.
#
# Optional.
#
#map 192.168.5.42 2001:db8:1:4444::1
#map 192.168.5.43 2001:db8:1:4444::2
#map 192.168.255.2 2001:db8:1:569::143


#
# Handling of UDP packets with zero checksum
# Per RFC7915, we can either drop the packet, or calculate a new checksum
# Additionally, Tayga also allows the option of forwarding the packet anyway
#
# Valid values:
#   drop
#   fwd
#   calc
#
# Default value: drop
# 
#udp-cksum-mode drop


#
# Logging packet errors
#
# List each option you would like to log with a space
# Valid options:
#   drop - packets which were DROPPED
#   reject - packets which were REJECTED (ICMP returned)
#   icmp - packets which returned an ICMP for any other reason
#   self - packets which were addressed to Tayga itself
#
# Default value: none
# 
#log drop reject icmp self

#
# Off-Link MTU
#
# Tayga will fragment IPv4->IPv6 packets which are larger than this size,
# unless the Don't Fragment bit is set. 
#
# IPv6 guarantees delivery of packets which are 1280 bytes or less. This
# behavior ensures that IPv4 packets will be delivered regardless of the
# MTU on subsequent links. IPv6 routers do not fragment packets which are
# too large, and IPv4 does not require Path MTU Discovery be used. 
#
# Increasing this limit will allow Tayga to translate packets which are larger
# than 1280 bytes, which may increase performance if you can guarantee that
# your network can transport packets up to this MTU end to end.
#
# Incorrectly setting this parameter may cause IPv4-translated packets to be
# dropped by IPv6 routers, in violation of expected IPv4 behavior. 
#
# Default value: 1280
