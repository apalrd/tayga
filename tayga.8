.SH NAME
tayga \- stateless NAT64 daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tayga
.I [OPTION]...
.PP
.B "tayga \-\-mktun"
.I [OPTION]...
.PP
.B "tayga \-\-rmtun"
.I [OPTION]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
TAYGA is a stateless NAT64 daemon for Linux and FreeBSD.  Using the in-kernel
TUN network driver, TAYGA receives IPv4 and IPv6 packets from the host's
network stack, translates them to the other protocol, and then sends the
translated packets back to the host using the same TUN interface.
.P
Translation is compliant with IETF RFC 7915, and address mapping is
performed in accordance with RFC 6052 and RFC 7757.  Optionally, TAYGA may be
configured to dynamically map IPv6 hosts to addresses drawn from a
configured IPv4 address pool.
.P
As a stateless NAT, TAYGA requires a one-to-one mapping between IPv4 addresses
and IPv6 addresses.  Mapping multiple IPv6 addresses onto a single IPv4
address can be achieved by mapping IPv6 addresses to private IPv4 addresses
with TAYGA and then using a stateful NAT44 (such as the iptables(8) MASQUERADE
target) to map the private IPv4 addresses onto the desired single IPv4 address.
.P
TAYGA's configuration is stored in the tayga.conf(5) file, which is usually
found in /etc/tayga.conf or /usr/local/etc/tayga.conf.

.SH INVOCATION
Without the
.B \-\-mktun
or
.B \-\-rmtun
options, the `tayga` executable runs as a daemon, translating packets as
described above.
.P
The
.B \-\-mktun
and
.B \-\-rmtun
options instruct TAYGA to create or destroy, respectively, its configured TUN
device as a "persistent" interface and then immediately exit.
.P
Persistent TUN devices remain present on the host system even when TAYGA is
not running.  This allows host-side network parameters and firewall rules to
be configured prior to commencement of packet translation.  This may simplify
network configuration on the host; for example, systems which use a
Debian-style /etc/network/interfaces file may configure TAYGA's TUN device at
boot by running `tayga \-\-mktun` as a "pre-up" command and then configuring the
TUN device as any other network interface.
